# Qr Generator

This is a simple web application built with React.js that allows users to generate QR codes and shorten URLs. The application provides the following features:

1. `QR Code Generation` : Users can enter a text or URL and generate a QR code representing that input. The QR code can be easily scanned by mobile devices or QR code readers.

2. `Save QR Code as Image` : Users have the option to save the generated QR code as an image file (e.g., PNG or JPEG). This allows for easy sharing or printing of the QR code.

3. `Link Shortening` : Users can also shorten long URLs using the application. By entering a URL, the application will generate a shortened version that is easier to share and remember.


## Technologies Used

The application is built using the following technologies:

* `React.js` : A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* `QRCode.react` : A React component for generating QR codes.
* `Shrt Code api` : An API that provides link shortening functionality.
